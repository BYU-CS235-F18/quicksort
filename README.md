# quicksort
In this tutorial we will help you to get started on the quicksort lab.  In this lab you will not be able to use a lot of the book code, so this tutorial will mostly show you examples of how to implement each step of the lab.  Remember that this is a no-help lab, so you cannot ask questions of the TAs, your neighbor or the internet when completing the lab.  You should make sure that all of the code you submit is your own.

First download the lab files.  They are in this git repository.  Then create "QS.h" that inherits from "QSInterface.h" and "QS.cpp" that implements the functions.  Make sure that your code compiles.
